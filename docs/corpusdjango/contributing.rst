Please, runs tests to be sure everything goes fine... And of course,
write/update new ones! Hey, did you really think we do this for fun?! ;-)

Just do :

.. code::

   tox

.. warning::
   Sometimes, you may need to rebuild the test env because there is new python
   packages updated in requirements/test.txt. So think about doing :

   .. code::

      tox -r

To improve tests, there are written in the dummy app ``apptest``. You can used
it or do what you can :-)
